2022/05/08: Day 2

Initial problems with elev motor stalling. Some gearbox PT and dangling the chiller tubes off the back fixed it.

Initial problems with v0.5 software tracking: PID's were flatlined. Ran 0.4 software, then back to 0.5 and now it works.

Got some early morning suntracking around 04:40. Generally very cloudy this morning.

cloudy tracking around 05:12

elevation pid output seems to have steps every now and then. Is this play in the gearbox that causes this? 
keeping a finger on the head seems to help

fov recipe at 05:34
recipe was wrong... it was repeating the azi. then it got cloud

tweaked the recipe to do elevation fov. steps seem a bit big

new elevation revipe withh smaller steps.
started 06:19
finished 06:26

finger darks:
vis low to high wavelengths
starting 06:28 finishing 06:29, around 10 seconds each

messed up the tracking... had to restart

came down from sky-viewing at zenith, to track sun by hand

nir following the barrels of vis (low to high)
starting 06:33 finished 0.34

modified the recipe for az and el fov
started around 07:00 - 07:01

restarted suntracking at 07:10

Tweaking the recipe to make the FOV scans broader. Recipe 1 is now azi fov
Recipe 2 is now elev fov

started elev fov 22:11-ish. sun is too high to do azi fov. The azi tracking pid needs to settle quicker
oops somwthing went haywire... had to cut the power

khallas habibi. I'm tired of sitting in the sun trying to write labview code
tweajed the code to fix the file header and make a display of a channel
looks like it only saves data when the tracking is running? check this.

2022/05/09: Day 3

setup before sunrise pointed about 15deg abovve the horizon. did tracksun so that data would be saved
as the sky gets brighter.
looks like a cloud layer slightly above the horizon.
04:24 - sun tracking with partial sun above the horizon.
computer time was wrong. set it. got it wrong! the clock  is 2hr fast
restarted the software and suntracking at 5:50 pm (computer time). looks like
we're maybe off by a few seconds.

darks: around 6:13  pm computer time
first using cloth on both barrels, then another one on the vis only for better contact

darks: around 6:32 pm computer time

darrks: around 6:52  pm computer time

darks around 19:10 computer time

darks around 19:38 computer time

darks around 20:00 computer time

20:14 computer time starting to get some cirrus around the area of the sun
20:22 cirrus cloud over the sun
ended the file around 20:24

20:25: elevation fov. aborted for cirrus
20:28 azi fov, finished around 20:34

20:35 started a new file
started a elev fov
robot went haywire at large negative pid setpoint
pulled the breaker. got back to sun-tracking around 20:49.

darks around 20:49 

stoped around 20:55. gonna go indoors and try setup the zero's on the ingaas channels.

did some tweaking of the ingaas dark currents with the trim pots. Data is saved as 20220509_211213_RADIOMETERS file.
It's hard to get all three amplification levels of the ingaas to be zero at the same time.

2022/5/10 06:48 (evening)
added temperature channels to the a/d. They are:
J7_4 (chan 35) hot block short lambda
J7_ (chan 38) cold block ch6
J7_ (chan 39) cold block ch9 (the other end)
J7_ (chan 36) hot block long lambda (the other end...)
J7 (chan 37) cold block copper heatsink


2022/05/10: Day 4 early morning
re-set computer clock to correct utc.
There's an upper layer of clouds which might preclude a good langley today.

started running at 15:28. we now have temperature monitoring so this might be interesting. Ambient temp is around 0-1C

sun peeking over the clouds at 15:47. steered to the sun and tracking

15:56 evidence of the cloud in the radiometer data.

15:57 darks

16:16 still on the edge of the visible cirrus clouds

16:22 sun  looks to be above the visible cirrus at airmass 8-9 approx

16:24 dark
16:52 darks
17:09 darks
17:25 darks
17:46 darks
????? darks (I think I did some but maybe didn't write it down)
18:20 darks
18:46 darks
19:01 darks
19:18 darjs

19:20 airmass is 1.35

gonna do some FOV
Azi first, finished at 19:28-29
Elev, robot glitched at 19:40 at around -1.75 setpoint.

19:45 started tweaking the PID on the hot block controller. Increased about 1/8 turn.
19:48 increased about another 1/8 turn

peak temp seems to introduce some noise into the temp sensors. is this from the TEC controller switching/changing polarity, which makes noise on the ground?

set the gain to peak gain. Temp oscillation almplitude seems to have decresased. 

set the gain to min around 19:54 to see what the other extreme is. Its not immediately clear what the optimum is.

shutdown 19:56

some afternoon tinkering around 00:20 on 2022/5/11. We still don't know which channels are which! Gonna work on data.

in the evening (2022/5/11 06:??GMT)
it looks like adding the temperature sensors adds noise, and changes the biasing of the photodiodes.

Day 5
2022/05/11

startup 15:20
some cirrus structure in the morning sky

15:36 tracking went wonky and looked at the ground. stalled the elev motor trying to get back on sun. restarted.

tracking is wonky with the sun just below the clouds, shutdown to wait for the proper sunrise

15:45 tracking again

16:35 messing with finger darks on ingaas
16:36 two sets of darks with a small gap in between. Long settling time looks like it must have been a cloud.
16:54 darks
17:11 darks
17:23 darks

17:42 looks like cirrus around?

17:45 ish darks?
17:58 darks
18:10 darks

18:14 finger darks bottom to top (low vis wavelength to high vis wavelenght)

18:40 darks
19:02 darks
19:20 darks
19:32 darks

19:33 start azi fov

modified the elev fov recipe: removed negative setpoints below -1.65 to try to avoid robot runaway issue.

stopped the software to get the ingaas diplay to run at the same speed at the vis.

restarted around 19:44 and re-run azi fov
it looks like the ingaas barrels are off in azi.

19:52 stopped the instr. modified the suntracking to be +2 offset in azi, this might be the offset of the ingaas channels.

 ingaas finger darks: bottom to top:
1 greem trace which is channel 19 which is CH7_0
2 blue trace which is channel 22 which is CH8_0
3 yellow trace which is channel 25 which is CH9_0
4 channel 24 responds which is CH8_4. ch 26 responds which is CH9_2.

stopped to reset the normal offsets for a vis azi fov starting at 20:20

did offset tracking to get some signal variability on nir. it appears that they are neg-goin, or at least ch7_0, ch8_0 and 9_0. Concluded that they are saturating while tracking.

increasd the azi tracking multiplier to tighten up the response.

continuing with tracking until solar noon. 

20:47 darks
21:08 darks
21:25 darks
21:45 darks

21:55 darks & shutdown for the day.

Evening:
REmoved the temperature monitoring to improve noise performance.
Attempted a filter change, but that would involve disassembly, and risks messing up the tracking alignment.

Day 6
2022/05/12
startup 15:14 looking towards the horizon.
some cirrus around this morning, but otherwise it looks like a good day. above the folding tower looks clear.

robot excursion... had to pull the plug & restart 15:39

15:52 darks
16:19 definitely cirrrus around
16:25 darks & cirrus around
16:50 darks & cirrus around
17:33 darks
18:00 darks
18:30 darks & lots of cirrus
18:48 darks & increasing cirrus & shutdown


Day 7
2022/05/13
clock is 5sec slow today
power up 15:27
suntracking 15:44 cirrus on the horizon over the sun and cirrus at "flag" height
16:01 darks
16:06 heading into some cirrus
16:19 looks clear of cirrus now
16:20 darks
16:35 cirrus developing above the sun
16:58 cirrus and darks
17:24 darks and cirrus around the sky
18:49 darks and cirrus appears to be clearing up
20:50 darks and clear sky
21:58 darks
22:13 darks
lots of wind blowing the instrument around, some convection forming around us. there was an excursion in AOD before this while we were doing 4STAR fiber-flexing tests. probably from the valley upwelling.
22:19 solar noon, darks, shutdown

Day 8
2022/05/14
computer time is good
warmup start 15:17
cirrus clouds are below the flag
tracking at 15:46, clouds across the sun
15:54 darks & clouds
15:59 maybe just above the clouds
16:22 darks
16:54 darks
17:32 possible cirrus across the sun?
17:33 darks
17:52 (and before) cirrus around? is there signal in the NIR? but it appears to be clearing
18:24 darks and definitely clearing
18:57 darks
19:48 darjs
20:41 shutdown
20:41 startup.... and darks and shutdown

Day 9
2022/05/15
full moon. moon tracking was mentioned. we can't see the setting moon from our platform for any reasonable length of time after setup.
computer time is good
warmup start 15:12
sky is full of cirrus
started tracking looking at the ground to test ingaas and high-gain
15:21 tracking excursion. stopped tracking for now.
lots of cirrus above the horizon up to airmass << 8
15:44 tracking
15:56 cirrus
16:15 cirrus
16:34 cirrus
16:54 darks & cirrus
17:34 darks & less cirrus but still lurking
17:58 darks
18:12 cirrus bands and solid cirrus above the sun
18:24 lots of cirrus
18:26 darks
18:27 shutdown
